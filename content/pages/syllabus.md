## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisite

## Outline

1. Linear response theory:
    - Fluctuation dissipation theorem
    - Scattering experiment
    - F-sum rule
2. Physics of disorder:
    - Kubo formula for conductivity
    - Conductance and sensitivity to boundary conditions
    - Scaling theory of localization
    - Mott variable range hopping
    - Quantum Hall effect
3. Superconductor revisited:
    - Transverse response: Landau diamagnetism
    - Microscopic derivation of London equation
        - Effect of disorder
    - Quasiparticles and coherence factors
    - Ginzburg-Landau theory
    - Vortices and type II superconductors
    - Tunneling and Josephson effect
4. Magnetism:
    - Local moment magnetism, exchange interaction
    - Ferro- and anti-ferro magnet and spin wave theory
    - Band magnetism — Stoner theory, spin density wave
5. Local moment in metals:
    - Friedel sum rule
    - Friedel-Anderson model
    - Kondo problem: singlet ground state
    - Kondo resonance
6. Fermi liquid theory:
    - Electron spectral function
    - Quasi-particles and Landau interaction parameters
    - Fermi liquid interpretation of the Kondo ground state

## Grading

The course grade is based entirely on the 12 homework assignments.
